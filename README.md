A group project compiling multiple machine learning methods on different tasks. Model used are: 
– a Linear Model
– a Generalised Linear Model with family set to Poisson
– a Generalised Linear Model with family set to Binomial
– a Generalised Additive Model
– a Neural Network
– a Support Vector Machine
