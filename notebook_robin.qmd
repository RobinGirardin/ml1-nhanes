As a proposition for a linear model,
we could explore factor influence on health.
Proxy for health could be self-rate health,
or a more objective variable such as
the BMI index or blood pressure.


```{r}
lm(BMI ~ PhysActiveDays + Height + SmokeNow + SmokeAge)
```

# GLM Poisson
The GLM Poisson handles a Poisson distribution.
Example of poisson distribution in our dataset is
the number of drinks
or the numbers of days wit poor mental or physical health.

```{r}
lm(AlcoholDay ~ SmokeNow + Poverty + HHIncome)
```

# GLM Binary
The GLM Binary handles binary distribution.
Example of interesting binary to investigate are
'SleepTrouble' or 'SmokeNow'.
