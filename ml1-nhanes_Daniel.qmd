## Data: NHANES (National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey)

We checked three different data sets:

-   ISLR, Introduction to Statistical Learning (book/package): `wages`

-   National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey: `nhanes`

-   UCI University of California, Irvine, Machine Learning Repository: `AdultUCI`

All three data sets meet the requirements for the project. Given the different analyses we will be conducting in the project, we opted for the data set with the **broadest range of variables**.

And: The topic of health also immediately **appealed to us**.

Selecting a few variables makes handling easier.

```{r}
#| label: "nhanes dataset"
#| include: false

data(NHANES)
# str(NHANES)

# Subset with ~20 variables (all types included)
nhanes_sub <- NHANES %>%
  select(
    # demographie
    SurveyYr, Gender, Age, AgeDecade, Race1, Education, MaritalStatus,
    HHIncome, HHIncomeMid, Poverty, HomeRooms, HomeOwn,
    
    # health (continuous + categorical)
    Height, Weight, BMI, HealthGen,
    Pulse, BPSysAve, BPDiaAve,
    
    # behaviour & life style
    PhysActive, PhysActiveDays, SleepHrsNight, SleepTrouble,
    Alcohol12PlusYr, AlcoholDay, AlcoholYear,
    SmokeNow, Smoke100, SmokeAge,
    
    # mental health
    DaysPhysHlthBad, DaysMentHlthBad,
    LittleInterest, Depressed
  )

## Analysis ideas

### Linear Model (continuous outcome: BMI)

```{r}
#| label: "LM model"

lm_bmi <- lm(BMI ~ Age + Gender + HHIncomeMid + PhysActive + Race1, data = nhanes_sub)
summary(lm_bmi)

```

### GLM Poisson (count outcome: AlcoholDay)

```{r}
#| label: "GLM Poisson"

glm_phys <- glm(AlcoholDay ~ Age + Gender + PhysActive + SleepTrouble + Race1, data = nhanes_sub, family = poisson)
summary(glm_phys)

```

### GLM Binomial (binary outcome: Depressed)

```{r}
#| label: "GLM Binomial"

glm_depressed <- glm(Depressed ~ Age + Gender + SleepHrsNight + PhysActive +
                   MaritalStatus, data = nhanes_sub,
                 family = binomial)
summary(glm_depressed)

```
